# Pydantic Basics Tutorial

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts and usage of Pydantic, a data validation library for Python. It includes various examples of data modeling, validation, and type checking using Pydantic's features.

## Project Structure

- `intro.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all examples and demonstrations
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration file

## Features Covered

1. Basic Model Creation
   - Simple Pydantic models
   - Type validation
   - Data parsing

2. Advanced Model Features
   - Optional fields
   - Default values
   - Nested models
   - List and custom types

3. Field Customization
   - Field constraints
   - Validation rules
   - Field descriptions
   - Custom validators

## Examples Include

- Person Model: Basic data modeling
- Employee Model: Optional fields and defaults
- Classroom Model: Working with lists and type casting
- Customer Model: Nested model structures
- Item Model: Field constraints and validation
- User Model: Field descriptions and schema generation

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pydantic
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook intro.ipynb
```

2. Run through the examples in the notebook to understand different Pydantic features.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Data validation
- Type checking
- Schema generation
- Model inheritance
- Field customization
- Optional fields
- Nested models
- List and custom types
